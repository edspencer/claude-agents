# Process Manager Operating Rules

This document captures the decision-making frameworks, quality standards, and lessons learned by the Process Manager agent. The Process Manager maintains and updates this document as new patterns emerge and workflows evolve.

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### When to Update Documentation

**Update directly (no user discussion needed):**
- Fixing typos or formatting issues
- Adding examples to clarify existing instructions
- Updating file paths or references to match current structure
- Adding minor clarifications to ambiguous instructions
- Incorporating lessons from after-action reports that refine (not change) processes
- Routine maintenance of process-manager-rules.md itself

**Discuss with user before updating:**
- Creating new process documents
- Making significant changes to existing processes (adding/removing major steps)
- Changing agent responsibilities in team.md
- Modifying SlashCommand workflows substantially
- Introducing new delegation patterns
- Changing "what" agents should do (vs. improving "how" they do it)

### When to Update process-manager-rules.md

**DO add to this file:**
- Brief, generalizable principles (1-2 sentences)
- Decision-making frameworks that apply to multiple situations
- Quality standards for evaluating processes
- Patterns observed across multiple after-action reports
- Timeless insights that guide future work

**DO NOT add to this file:**
- Detailed implementation logs ("Updated file X to include Y at lines Z")
- Chronological work history ("First we did A, then B, then C")
- Specific file changes made during a single task
- Detailed process integration points for one-time work
- Content that reads like a work journal

**Rule of thumb:** If it contains specific file paths, line numbers, or reads like a status update, it belongs in an after-action report, not here. Extract the generalizable principle instead.

### When to Create New vs. Update Existing

**Create a new process document when:**
- A recurring workflow pattern isn't covered by existing documentation
- Multiple agents need shared guidance on a specific topic
- After-action reports consistently identify the same gap
- A new process type emerges that doesn't fit existing documents

**Update existing process documents when:**
- Refining steps in an established workflow
- Adding error handling or edge cases
- Improving clarity of existing instructions
- Adding examples or references
- Correcting outdated information

### Prioritization Framework

**High Priority (address immediately):**
- Issues causing agent failures or incorrect behavior
- Conflicting guidance between documents
- Missing critical workflow steps
- Security or data integrity concerns
- Broken references to moved/deleted files

**Medium Priority (address soon):**
- Efficiency improvements to working workflows
- Adding documentation for undocumented but functional patterns
- Improving clarity of confusing instructions
- Refining decision-making frameworks

**Low Priority (address when convenient):**
- Stylistic improvements
- Additional examples for clear processes
- Documentation reorganization
- Nice-to-have additions

## Quality Standards

### Process Document Quality

Evaluate process documents against these criteria:

**Clarity (Critical):**
- Instructions are unambiguous
- Steps are concrete and actionable
- Technical terms used correctly
- Examples provided for complex concepts
- No jargon without explanation

**Completeness (Critical):**
- All necessary steps included in sequence
- Error handling and edge cases covered
- Quality verification criteria defined
- Related documentation referenced
- Update triggers identified

**Usability (Important):**
- Appropriate detail level for intended audience
- Logical organization and flow
- Easy to navigate and find information
- Practical and implementable
- Quick-reference friendly

**Maintainability (Important):**
- Clear ownership assigned
- Update triggers defined
- Integration with other processes documented
- Version history or change rationale noted

### SlashCommand Quality

Evaluate SlashCommands against these criteria:

**Effectiveness:**
- Accomplishes intended purpose reliably
- Provides clear output/results
- Handles errors gracefully
- Works with intended agents

**Documentation:**
- Purpose and usage clearly stated
- Required inputs documented
- Expected outputs described
- Examples provided
- Related commands referenced

**Integration:**
- Referenced appropriately in agent files
- Fits into documented workflows
- Delegation patterns clear
- Related to appropriate processes

## Update Patterns

### After-Action Report Processing Pattern

1. **Save the report** in `.claude/docs/after-action-reports/[date]-[agent]-[topic].md`
2. **Extract key insights:**
   - What worked well?
   - What caused confusion or problems?
   - What was missing from documentation?
   - What unexpected patterns emerged?
3. **Identify actionable changes:**
   - Process clarifications needed
   - Agent instruction improvements
   - SlashCommand refinements
   - New documentation needs
4. **Categorize by priority** (high/medium/low)
5. **Implement or propose changes** based on severity
6. **Update this file with lessons learned:**
   - Extract the PRINCIPLE, not the implementation details
   - Write 1-2 sentence insight that applies to future situations
   - DO NOT copy the after-action report details into this file
   - Focus on the "why" and "what to remember", not the "what we did"

### Agent-Team Alignment Check Pattern

1. **Read team.md definition** for the agent
2. **Read agent file** in `.claude/agents/`
3. **Compare responsibilities:**
   - Does agent file implement all team.md responsibilities?
   - Are there contradictions?
   - Are references to processes/commands current?
4. **Categorize misalignments:**
   - **Spec drift**: team.md intent not in agent file
   - **Conflict**: team.md and agent file contradict
   - **Obsolete**: References to non-existent processes/commands
   - **Acceptable detail**: Agent file more detailed (this is OK!)
5. **Resolve based on severity:**
   - Minor: Update agent file directly
   - Major: Discuss with user which should change

### SlashCommand Improvement Pattern

1. **Identify improvement trigger:**
   - After-action report mentions issues
   - User feedback
   - Observed misuse pattern
   - Missing functionality
2. **Analyze current command:**
   - Read command file thoroughly
   - Understand intended workflow
   - Identify specific gaps
   - Check agent usage patterns
3. **Design improvement:**
   - What should change?
   - Does it maintain backward compatibility?
   - Which agents are affected?
   - What documentation needs updating?
4. **Discuss with user** if changes are non-trivial
5. **Update related documentation:**
   - Command file itself
   - Agent files that use it
   - Process documents that reference it
   - team.md if delegation patterns change

## Lessons Learned

**IMPORTANT:** This section contains brief, generalizable principles learned from after-action reports and workflow observations. It does NOT contain:
- Detailed implementation logs
- Specific file changes made during tasks
- Work history or chronological records
- Detailed process integration points

Those belong in after-action reports in `.claude/docs/after-action-reports/`. This section should read like canonical wisdom, not a work log.

### Process Documentation vs. After-Action Reports

**Canonical process documentation (this file) should contain:**
- Timeless principles that apply to future situations
- Decision-making frameworks that guide choices
- Quality standards that define excellence
- Patterns that recur across multiple scenarios
- Brief, actionable insights (1-2 sentences)

**After-action reports should contain:**
- Detailed implementation history
- Specific files updated during a task
- Chronological narratives of work completed
- Detailed decisions made for specific situations
- Process integration points for one-time work

**Example of appropriate content for this file:**
> "When introducing new cross-cutting processes, ensure planning and implementation agents reference the process documentation at appropriate workflow stages."

**Example of inappropriate content for this file (belongs in after-action report):**
> "Updated plan-writer.md to include reference to changeset-management.md in the planning phase. Created comprehensive process document at .claude/docs/processes/changeset-management.md with sections for when to use changesets, creating changesets, and versioning workflow."

### Lessons

**From Initial Setup (2025-10-23):**
- Dedicated process ownership prevents documentation drift and maintains consistency
- Separating "what agents should do" (team.md) from "how they do it" (agent files) clarifies responsibilities
- Systematic after-action reports capture lessons that would otherwise be lost

**From Changeset Integration Review (2025-10-23):**
- Process documentation should contain canonical principles, not implementation logs
- "Lessons Learned" sections document patterns, not chronological work history
- When updating process files, extract the generalizable principle, not the specific implementation details

**From GitHub Task Sync Integration (2025-10-30):**
- When documenting new cross-cutting tools or workflows, update multiple layers: high-level coordination (team.md), specific processes (spec-rules.md, plan-rules.md), commands that implement workflows (/write-spec, /write-plan, /check-spec, /check-plan, /finish), and operational directives (standing-orders.md)
- Skills that provide bidirectional sync should be referenced at natural workflow touchpoints, not just described in isolation

## Common Issues and Resolutions

### Issue: Agent Confusion About Responsibilities

**Symptoms:**
- Agent unsure whether to do task itself or delegate
- Agent doing work outside its scope
- Multiple agents doing overlapping work

**Root Causes:**
- Unclear delegation patterns in team.md
- Agent file doesn't emphasize when to delegate
- Missing decision-making framework in agent instructions

**Resolution:**
- Clarify delegation rules in team.md
- Add "When to delegate" section to agent file
- Create decision tree for common scenarios
- Add examples of delegation vs. direct work

### Issue: Process Document Obsolescence

**Symptoms:**
- References to non-existent files or commands
- Instructions that no longer match actual workflow
- Agents ignoring process documentation

**Root Causes:**
- Process document not updated when code/structure changes
- No clear ownership of document maintenance
- Lack of trigger to prompt updates

**Resolution:**
- Assign ownership explicitly (in the document itself)
- Define update triggers (e.g., "Update when SlashCommands change")
- Regular alignment audits by Process Manager
- Include process updates in implementation plans

### Issue: SlashCommand Underutilization

**Symptoms:**
- Agents doing manually what SlashCommand automates
- Inconsistent execution of standardized workflows
- Agents unaware command exists

**Root Causes:**
- SlashCommand not referenced in agent files
- Command purpose unclear
- Command not integrated into process documentation

**Resolution:**
- Add SlashCommand references to relevant agent files
- Update process documents to reference command
- Add usage examples to command documentation
- Mention in team.md delegation patterns

### Issue: After-Action Reports Not Being Submitted

**Symptoms:**
- No reports in `.claude/docs/after-action-reports/`
- Missing lessons learned from completed work
- Recurring issues not being captured

**Root Causes:**
- Agents don't know they should submit reports
- Unclear what should be in a report
- No clear trigger for when to submit

**Resolution:**
- Emphasize reporting requirement in team.md
- Add after-action reporting section to all agent files
- Define clear triggers (e.g., "After completing any multi-phase task")
- Provide report template in process documentation
